You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

Well, ok then! It took me four tries but I finally found the template that makes sense with GitPages as a total beginner. The video I saw in my class content helped me get this far. I also tried to push my own index file created on my computer via Notepad and Git Bash as the terminal. I was able to create repositories, but struggled with seeing the web page ever show up. I can see now how forking from a template that is compatible with GitHub pages and then naming it as your website repository that comes free with GitHub is a valid solution. I learned a lot though about how to use concepts of remote and local, push and pull, and origin and master (or main). I have a ways to go to be a pro at it but this is a great start!

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
